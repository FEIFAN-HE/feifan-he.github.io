# Introduction

## Once a year, I would take a trip to explore a new mountain, seeing what nature looks like on the top of the mountain makes hours of hiking worthwhile.

## I enjoy taking on new challenges, teaching myself programming to perform analytics on the current world trends became one of my favorite pastime activities.

## I’m grateful to my parents for always being there for me, watching me achieve one of the most important milestones of my life, and many more to come.

## Since 16, I have a goal of traveling the world, and I’m making good progress to date.

## I was lucky to be raised by my grandma in my early childhood, she alway taught me never to underestimate what I can do, never underestimate what women can do.

## Spending 7 years by myself in Toronto has taught me a lot of things, one of which is becoming independent.
